### Welcome to my Portfolio,

I am an Automobile Engineer, I did my graduation from [Pillai College of Engineering](https://www.pce.ac.in/) affiliated by [Mumbai University](https://mu.ac.in/). 
In November 2022, I started working at TuringMind.Ai as a Data Scientist Trainee. Currently, I am also doing my Master's from the [University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/) 
in the feild of Data Science. The reason for doing my MS in Data Science after being graduated as an Automobile Engineer is the High Demand and growth of
Data Science in the feild of Automobile and I also want to be a part of this growth.

These page showcase all the projects which I did in the past and the one's on which currently I am working.

## Active Projects 
    
    Currently I am not working on any project,
    Soon I will update this section. 
    
## Completed Projects
   ### Suspension Tunning of Vehicle for Different Conditions - Jul 2021 - Mar 2022
   
      Suspension Tunning of Vehicle for Different Conditions
      was my final year project. 
      Highlights of this project are:
        1. Setting tuning parameters for the suspension
           system of a vehicle so the vehicle can perform 
           well in different road conditions.
        2. Developing quarter car model for Passive & 
           Semi-Active Suspension in MATLAB Simulink.
        3. Applying the tuning parameters to the suspension
           system and testing the model in different conditions.
        4. Comparing the results to see the performance of
           the Passive & Semi-Active Suspension system 
           in different road conditions.

   ### Design, Modelling and Analysis of a Bicycle Frame - Mar 2021 - May 2021
   
      As the title describes we design a bicycle frame and 
      performed some static load tests to analyze the impact of various 
      loads acting on a frame in different conditions.

   ### Internship Based Project - CAD Modelling of An IC Engine - Dec 2021 - Jan 2022
       
      1. Dismantling of an IC Engine (Force Matador D301 E2) 
         and measuring the dimensions of the components.
      2. Creating a CAD model of the components of the engine.
      3. Doing Assembly of the Engine and creating a working
         Simulation of an IC Engine.
